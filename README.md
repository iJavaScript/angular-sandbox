# Notes

1. [X] `constant` v.s `value`
  - constant can be use in `module.config` but not value
  - rule of thumb: value for service object / function, constant for configuration data.
2. [ ] what is `angular:common`
3. [X] what is `angular:decorate`
  - Think about AOP
  - Like Python decorate?
4. [X] What's `provider`?
  - In short words, like `factory` service but allow global customization via `config` phase.

5. [] Try `ng-anotation`
